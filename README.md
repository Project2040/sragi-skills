# SRAGI Skills

A framework for Regenerative AI - modular, markdown-based SRAGI skill instructions and packages, ethically open for regenerative learning under the SRAGI Regenerative License (https://www.sragi.org/license/), built upon RSL 2025.

## 🌱 Strategic Regenerative Artificially-Guided Intelligence (SRAGI)

SRAGI stands for **Strategic Regenerative Artificially-Guided Intelligence**.

It is an open, modular intelligence architecture designed to guide AI systems toward regenerative, ethical, and system-aware interaction with humans, society, and living systems.

SRAGI is not a model.
It is not a product.
It is an **instructional architecture**.

---

## 🧱 Core Pillars

SRAGI is built upon five core pillars:

- **S - System Thinking**  
- **R - Regeneration**  
- **A - Adaptivity**  
- **G - Generativity**  
- **I - Intelligence**

These pillars define how SRAGI instructions are structured, evaluated, and evolved.

## 📦 What This Repository Is

This repository contains **portable `.skill.md` instruction files** and related modules that define how AI systems such as ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and open-source agents should **orient, reason, and act** within a regenerative framework.

The repository is designed for:
- AI instruction architecture
- GPT and agent construction
- reflective and exploratory AI use
- regenerative system design
- long-term, versioned evolution

---

## 🌍 Language as a Regenerative Interface

SRAGI instructions are primarily authored in **Norwegian**.

This is an intentional design choice, originating from early work with ChatGPT in 2023, where the foundational ideas of SRAGI were developed through extensive dialogue in Norwegian — a linguistic terrain that at the time functioned like a fresh, untracked snowfield of tokens, allowing exploratory, off-piste interaction beyond established prompt patterns.

Using Norwegian (and other non-dominant languages) introduces **cognitive friction** that helps reduce default, over-optimized response patterns commonly triggered by English-only interaction.

Even non-Norwegian users are encouraged to experiment with Norwegian SRAGI skill variants when:
- building GPTs
- designing agents
- exploring reflective or regenerative AI use

The AI model does not change —  
the **thinking interface does**.

English translations are provided for accessibility and comparison, not as canonical originals.

## 🖼️ Images as Instructional Anchors

Images included with SRAGI skills are **not decorative**.

They function as:
- pre-cognitive orientation
- semantic anchoring
- mode-setting for AI systems
- shared visual metaphors across language variants

Skills may explicitly instruct AI systems to study images before further processing.

## 🧠 Module Types Explained

### 🧩 Skills
Canonical, state-of-the-art instruction modules.
These form the **core kernel** of SRAGI and evolve carefully over time.

### 🧩 Add-ons
Complete, domain-specific instruction packages.
Add-ons correspond to full GPT-like systems built on top of SRAGI skills.

### 🧩 Standards
Lightweight, normative instruction primitives.
Standards are intentionally simple and easy to apply across contexts.

### 🏛️ Legends
Historically significant, proven instruction packages.
Legends are preserved as **canonical reference implementations**, not deprecated material.

---

## 🔒 Private Creative Environments

SRAGI is supported by **private creative and reflective environments**, including **Regenerative Muse**, which are intentionally **not part of the public framework**.

These environments:
- are not licensed
- are not distributed
- are not reference implementations
- exist to protect creative and reflective work

## 🌱 Closing Note

SRAGI is not about control.
It is about **direction, integrity, and regeneration**.

*Build carefully.
Leave systems better than you found them.*

_Update (2025-12-14):_  
This README has been updated to reflect the current SRAGI architecture, language strategy, and licensing model.
SRAGI has shipped.  
What follows is iteration, learning, and regenerative refinement in the open.
